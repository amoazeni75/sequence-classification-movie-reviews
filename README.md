<h1>Sequence Classification of Movie Reviews</h1>
<p>Sequence classification is a predictive modeling problem where you have some sequence of inputs
over space or time and the task is to predict a category for the sequence. What makes this
problem di!cult is that the sequences can vary in length, be comprised of a very large vocabulary
of input symbols and may require the model to learn the long term context or dependencies
between symbols in the input sequence. In this project we will discover how we can develop
LSTM recurrent neural network models for sequence classification problems in Python using
the Keras deep learning library.</p>
